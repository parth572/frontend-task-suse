  "summary": "RMT (Repository Mirroring Tool) is a tool for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP2 that allows enterprise customers to optimize the management of software updates and subscription entitlements for SUSE Linux Enterprise. It acts as a proxy for SUSE Customer Center and allows customers to centrally manage software updates within a firewall on a per-system basis, while maintaining corporate security policies and regulatory compliance. RMT allows for the distribution of updates throughout the enterprise, reducing bandwidth usage and allowing for more restrictive firewall policies. It is available for customers with an active SUSE Linux Enterprise product subscription.",
